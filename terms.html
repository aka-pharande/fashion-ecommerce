        <br><br><br>
        <p> Please read these terms and conditions ("terms and conditions", "terms") carefully before using Her Closet
          website.</p>
        <h4> Conditions of use: </h4>
        <p>By using this website, you certify that you have read and reviewed this Agreement and that you agree to
          comply with its terms. If you do not want to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, you are advised to leave
          the website accordingly. Her Closet only grants use and access of this website, its products, and its services
          to those who have accepted its terms. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4> Shipping: </h4>
        <p>If Her Closet (“we”) has your product(s) in stock, we will email you a shipping notice confirming that the
          items have shipped and are en-route to you or, in the case of delivered orders, a special delivery notice
          confirming the scheduled delivery date; that shipping notice or special delivery notice, as applicable, is our
          acceptance of your order. In-stock orders (excluding scheduled delivery items) normally ship within 2 business
          days of placing your order. Out-of-stock orders will ship once the item is back in stock. How soon you receive
          the product(s) depends on the shipping method you have chosen. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4> Pre-orders: </h4>
        <p>Release dates for products can sometimes change without notice or liability. If you’ve pre-ordered a product,
          we’ll ship it as soon as possible after its final release date, which may be different from the initial date
          advertised.</p>
        <p>To the extent permitted by law, we reserve the right at any time to reject, correct, cancel or terminate any
          order for any reason whatsoever. If the price of any product you order was incorrectly displayed on our Web
          Site, we will provide you with an opportunity to place an order at the correct price.</p>
        <p>Advertisements on our Web Site are invitations to you to make offers to purchase products and services on the
          Web Site and are not offers to sell. Your properly completed and delivered order form constitutes your offer
          to purchase the products or services referenced in your order. Your order will be deemed to be accepted only
          if and when we send a shipping notice email or special delivery notice email for scheduled delivery items, to
          your email address. That shipping notice email or special delivery notice email constitutes our acceptance of
          your order and forms a legally binding contract with Her Closet.</p>
